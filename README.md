# DPFN-Game (Personal Project)
2-Player JavaScript-based, personal trivia game in the browser!

Uses a backend Node server with Express and socket.io to communicate between a host device and 2 mobile client devices. The UI is mostly crafted with P5.js, HTML and CSS. Add custom questions to text files to play. Length of the game is dictated by the amount of questions added.
