# DPFN-Game (Personal Project)
2-Player JavaScript-based, personal trivia game

Uses a node.js server to communicate between host device and client devices. The UI/UX is mostly crafted with P5.js and CSS. Add custom questions to text files to play. Length of the game is dictated by the amount of questions added.
